## This is Salomon's REPL game

### You have the option of playing 2 different games: 

#### 1) a food game
#### 2) a dead or alive game

#### At the beginning of the game it asks you which game you would like to begin playing, you then play the game you chose.
#### When that game is finished it will loop around and ask you which game you would like to begin playing, once again.
#### If you do not press #1 or #2, then the game will halt and let you know that you pressed the incorrect key.
#### The game of games will only stop looping when you press the #3 which indicates that you are quitting the game.
